# Automation Examples

This is a collection of example scripts demonstrating Infrastructure-As-Code tools against Skyscape's vCloud Director API.

The contents of this repository are used in a Series of blog posts at http://robcoward.blogspot.co.uk/ to demonstrate how to make best use of automation and the API interfaces to the Skyscape Cloud Services infrastructure.

For more information, please refer to the README.md files in each sub-directory, or the associated blog posts.
